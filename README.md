# PneumoniaClassification

  
**Target:** To build a model that can recognize pneumonia in lung using Deep Learning.

**About the model:** We use a model here known as `resnet34`, trained using about `1.3` million images.

**Dataset:** *Mohirdev Pnevmoniya* (dataset consisting of `5226` CXR pictures)
